# SellSquare
![Logo](/docs/logo.png)

Made for the BizHacks Hackathon in February 2020, SellSquare is a program designed to better facilitate the categorization of items in an online store. 
Using AWS technologies like S3 Storage and Rekognition SellSquare inteligently identifies the category your product fits best.

The service is built in Python using the Flask web framework and was made in just 24 hours based on a prompt from Best Buy, who sponsored the event.
